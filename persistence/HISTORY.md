# Architectural and operational decisions

## 2026-09-23 — Codex-primary local curation boundary

**Decision:** Use Hermes profile `gptmd-coding` with the Codex app-server runtime
as the implementation lane, and CuratorMD as a local, reviewable persistence
layer. Canonical durable knowledge is limited to the four files in this
directory; native-projection records are temporary inbox input.

**Rationale:** Codex owns workspace edits and tests, while Hermes provides
project-local orchestration, session history, and background review. Keeping
the durable boundary in checked-in Markdown makes authority reviewable and
avoids treating local memory or raw transcripts as project rules.

**Impact:** CuratorMD requires an absolute worktree root, redacts observer
payloads, stores state outside the repository, acquires a project lock, and
never commits or modifies application source.

## 2026-09-25 — Add reusable new-repository enablement skill

**Decision:** Add `enable-hermes-repo` to the gptmd-memory plugin. It codifies absolute worktree validation, contract and persistence review, unique Hermes profile and schedule selection, Codex plugin verification, CuratorMD and OpenAI Docs MCP registration, profile skill installation, observer and cron verification, VS Code profile binding, and final build/status checks.

**Rationale:** The nuxt008 onboarding exposed repeated setup steps and a status-checker path mismatch for repositories that use the installed CuratorMD plugin instead of carrying a local plugin directory.

**Impact:** Future repository onboarding can use one discoverable skill plus the idempotent `enable_repo.py` bootstrap, with reviewable local-only changes and explicit live verification.
