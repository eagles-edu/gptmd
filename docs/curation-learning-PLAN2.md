# CuratorMD review learning and proposal workflow

## Summary

Extend CuratorMD so lifecycle events become human-readable review proposals, approved entries append to the selected persistence Markdown file, and finalized review decisions feed an external six-month learning dataset.

The system will recompute its analysis every 21 days and remain human-review-only until statistically meaningful baselines exist.

## Key changes

**example prose**:

 > date -- Provider openai-codex using profile-bound gptmd-coding, deployed gpt-5.6-luna and performed local "**hermes:gptmd-coding:live-hook-test:agent:end**" ( fingerprint: a3c7b8f33c1c58f520a29d2a209 | record_id: 68b3db3f6a430b8f09e7917a6626e).

This humanized format says everything an entry should have... more info still goes in between "**event description**" when appropriate.

The system should learn from my responses and improve its decision making, like not noting ending a test  in favor of test results IF significant to project.

```json

{
"reviewed": true,
"candidate": {
  "priority": "none=0; low=1; moderate=2; high=3; max=4; immutable=5",
  "archive": "proposed *.md file: 1. 'agents', 2. 'sop', 3. 'history', 4. 'lessons' ",
  "title": "proposed short description title",
  "content": "content is in above payload json -- write proposed entry prose from payload. un-redact response to produce a safe summary for consideration",
  "utility": "Why this is useful for 1. codifying project development goals/structure, 2. maintaining consistent/best procedural practices, 3. recording important historical decisions/milestones, or 4. preventing repetition of past mistakes.",
  "impact": "What changes going forward.",
  "disposition": "approved=1;  dom't record=0; pending"
}
}

```
**priority** grades the importance of a particular event to the project and is used in deciding when an item is recorded 0=never, the weight assigned to an item regarding its utility to the project overall development goals, 1, 2, 3, & 4, and aids in refactoring/compaction by inferring disposition rank among same archive entries where higher ranking info should be retained for summarization or archiving; or, may be most suitable for future culling, "if it's no longer germane, we don't retain." Finally, if an event is so profound as to have a lasting impact on the projects goals, it can be marked immutable=5.

- Replace the current candidate shape with:

  ```json

  {
    "reviewed": false,
    "candidate": {
      "priority": 0,
      "archive": "history",
      "title": "Short description",
      "content": "Human-readable proposed entry.",
      "utility": "Why this is useful.",
      "impact": "What changes going forward.",
      "disposition": "pending"
    }
  }

  ```

- Generate deterministic proposals containing date, provider, profile, model, event type, fingerprint, and record ID. Additional details remain quoted and bounded.
- Support `archive` values: `agents`, `sop`, `history`, and `lessons`; append approved entries to the bottom of that file.
- Treat dispositions as:
  - `pending`: remains for review.
  - `approved`: append to Markdown and record the decision.
  - `do-not-record`: record the feedback decision but do not modify Markdown.
- Keep `priority` independent from disposition, using integer values `0`–`5`.
- Fix processing so pending or incomplete records are not permanently marked processed. Existing records can be edited and reviewed later.
- Validate malformed candidates without aborting the complete curator run.
- Preserve compatibility with existing `kind`, `rationale`, and `impact` candidates during migration.

```json

turning
{
"reviewed": true,
"candidate": {
  "priority": "none=0; low=1; moderate=2; high=3; max=4; immutable=5", // 0-5
  "archive": "proposed *.md file placement: 1. 'agents', 2. 'sop', 3. 'history', 4. 'lessons' ", // 1-4
  "title": "proposed short description title", //  must define pertinent eval
  "content": "content is in above payload json -- write proposed entry prose from payload. un-redact response to produce a safe summary for consideration", //  must define pertinent eval
  "utility": "Why this is useful for 1. codifying project development goals/structure, 2. maintaining consistent/best procedural practices, 3. recording important historical decisions/milestones, or 4. preventing repetition of past mistakes.", //  1-4
  "impact": "What changes going forward.", // quantify potential for ensuring a positive effect on the quality of project goals 0=none/benign, 1=limited effect, 2=strong effect. 3-mission critical effect.
  "disposition": "approved=1;  dom't record=0" // 0-1
}
}

```

## Learning dataset

- Store bounded, redacted decision JSON in external CuratorMD plugin state, not the repository.
- Record event metadata, disposition, priority, archive, and bounded content/utility/impact audit data.
- Exclude free text from regression features; use only metadata and review labels.
- Retain six months of decisions.
- Recompute the complete retained dataset every 21 days.
- Produce deterministic regression outputs for:
  - approval versus do-not-record likelihood;
  - expected priority;
  - likely archive.
- Keep sparse event categories in Phase 1 until they have at least six months of data and sufficient reviewed examples for a conservative confidence gate.

## Automation phases

- Phase 1: generate suggestions only; human review is required.
- Phase 2: optionally auto-reject strongly established routine categories, while recording every automatic decision.
- Phase 3: optionally auto-approve strongly established categories only after the same evidence gate and an explicit operator configuration change.
- Routine events such as test completion default to low priority and should be suppressed or downgraded unless they contain a significant result, failure, fix, or project decision.

## Interface and documentation

- Add decision-analysis status to the curator result and status output.
- Add a report command/MCP operation showing learning phase, dataset age, sample counts, recomputation time, and category confidence.
- Update the CuratorMD README, SOP, and tests with the new approval and learning workflow.
- Do not commit inbox records, plugin state, or generated Markdown automatically.

## Test plan

- Deterministic human-readable proposal generation.
- Valid and invalid disposition, priority, and archive values.
- Approved entries append to the selected Markdown file.
- Do-not-record decisions never modify persistence files.
- Pending records remain reprocessable after manual edits.
- Existing legacy candidates still promote correctly.
- Decision data is redacted, external, bounded, and retained for six months.
- Recalculation runs over the full retained dataset every 21 days.
- Sparse categories remain Phase 1.
- Routine test-ending events receive low-priority suggestions.
- Regression results are deterministic and never auto-approve before the configured evidence gate.
- Existing CuratorMD tests continue to pass.

## Assumptions

- The raw native inbox remains temporary and retains its existing 30-day cleanup policy.
- The six-month decision dataset is separate from canonical project knowledge.
- Phase 3 is implemented but remains disabled until explicitly enabled after the evidence report is reviewed.
- No external Python ML dependency is added; the regression implementation remains local and deterministic.
